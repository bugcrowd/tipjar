## Most Frequently Used Hacking Tools Twitter Thread

```
This thread is filled with great tool suggestions from a lot of great hackers. Some of the most common are:

- Burp Suite
- ffuf
- nmap
- curl
- nuclei
```

## Port Forwarding using Socat

Source: https://twitter.com/mubix/status/1347385031673704454

```
Forward port 80 on your host, to an IP / port on another:
socat TCP-LISTEN:80,fork TCP:192.168.1.100:80

Forward port 80 on your host, to an IP / port on another OVER a SOCKS proxy:
socat tcp-listen:80,fork SOCKS4:127.0.0.1:192.168.1.100:80,socksport=9050
```

## Grep for Code Analysis

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1349525327811231745

```
If you're hunting for low-hanging bugs in source code, grep and regex can help you to identify hotspots. For example, you might find basic rXSS in PHP with something like this:

grep -r "echo.*\$_\(GET\|REQUEST\|POST\)" .

Or to uncover potential SQL injection you could try:

grep -r "SELECT.*\\.\\ \\$" .

It will still take some manual work, but this can be a good way to focus your attention on the most obvious weak points.

To take this technique to the next level, checkout gf by tomnomnom: https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf.

For some more tasty regex ideas, checkout the [Trufflehog regexes](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHogRegexes/blob/master/truffleHogRegexes/regexes.json).

## html-tool from tomnomnom
find . -type f | html-tool attribs src (this will give all of the src attributes from all of the files)
 find . -type f | html-tool tags title | vim - ( give the title tag from all of the files)

## Random shell tricks
```
Takes all the files cats them & use tok to make wordlists | vim
find . -type f -exec cat {} \; | tok 

Add http:// 
sed -E 's/^/http:\/\//g' domains.txt &> hosts

greps for '200 ok ' & sorts them numerically by size 

grep -lri '200 ok ' | grep -v ^index | xargs -n1 ls -la | sort -k5,5 -n
usefull
To check for subdomain takeover

 cat domains | while read domain; do host -t CNAME $domain; done | grep -i azure  (you can grep for anything that hosts check https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz )
 
 Inscope:  tool for filtering URLs and domains supplied on stdin to make sure they meet one of a set of regular expressions. 
 It's in tomnomnom's hacks repo
 The tool reads regexes from a file called .scope in the current working directory. If it doen't find one it recursively checks the parent directory until it hits the root.

Here's an example .scope file:

.*\.example\.com$
^example\.com$
.*\.example\.net$
!.*outofscope\.example\.net$

Using Ctrl keys

(source:random reddit guy)

Ctrl + n : same as Down arrow.
Ctrl + p : same as Up arrow.
Ctrl + r : begins a backward search through command history.(keep pressing Ctrl + r to move backward)
Ctrl + s : to stop output to terminal.
Ctrl + q : to resume output to terminal after Ctrl + s.
Ctrl + a : move to the beginning of line.
Ctrl + e : move to the end of line.
Ctrl + d : if you've type something, Ctrl + d deletes the character under the cursor, else, it escapes the current shell.
Ctrl + k : delete all text from the cursor to the end of line.
Ctrl + x + backspace : delete all text from the beginning of line to the cursor.
Ctrl + t : transpose the character before the cursor with the one under the cursor, press Esc + t to transposes the two words before the cursor.
Ctrl + w : cut the word before the cursor; then Ctrl + y paste it
Ctrl + u : cut the line before the cursor; then Ctrl + y paste it
Ctrl + _ : undo typing.
Ctrl + l : equivalent to clear.
Ctrl + x + Ctrl + e : launch editor defined by $EDITOR to input your command. Useful for multi-line commands.


Run last command 
!!
eg: if you forgot to add sudo with a command you can do sudo !! to execute last command with sudo,
  of course you can use this with any command

The tree command is very cool
you can use it to list the contents of a directory in a tree-like format


```




## Vim Tricks
source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8iXMgk2nnY (nom nom!)
```
:%!sort -u (% means current file, ! to run shell command)
you can run shell commands right inside vim.

xargs takes multiple lines of input and runs a command on every line of it.

`%!xargs -n1 -I{} sh -c 'echo {} | base64 -d' (n1 -> give 1 input at a time, -I{} is a placeholder of input, sh -c -> to pass the command to shell )
Search and replace
:%s/\<search_item>/\<replace>

:%s/// (// -> it search for whatever you last searched for)

you can use unfurl tool by @tomnomnom to do some cool stuff
:%!unfurl -u paths (this will find unique paths from the urls in the vim buffer)
:%!unfurl -u keys (to get query strings)

```
vim is very powerfull you can use `vimtutor` & go through it to learn vim.
I also recommend reading [Mastering Vim Quickly: From WTF to OMG in no time. Book](https://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/)
