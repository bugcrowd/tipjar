## Port Forwarding using Socat

```
Forward port 80 on your host, to an IP / port on another:
socat TCP-LISTEN:80,fork TCP:192.168.1.100:80

Forward port 80 on your host, to an IP / port on another OVER a SOCKS proxy:
socat tcp-listen:80,fork SOCKS4:127.0.0.1:192.168.1.100:80,socksport=9050
```

## Grep for Code Analysis

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1349525327811231745

```
If you're hunting for low-hanging bugs in source code, grep and regex can help you to identify hotspots. For example, you might find basic rXSS in PHP with something like this:

grep -r "echo.*\$_\(GET\|REQUEST\|POST\)" .

Or to uncover potential SQL injection you could try:

grep -r "SELECT.*\\.\\ \\$" .

It will still take some manual work, but this can be a good way to focus your attention on the most obvious weak points.

To take this technique to the next level, checkout gf by tomnomnom: https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf.
